# Advance-Concepts
I have used structure, strings, functions & file concepts of C-language to program a factorial calculator.
Here I have uploaded 3 files, first one is the code file, 2nd one is the text file used to do operation on it using the programming & 3rd file is the text file after running our code.
Thank you.
